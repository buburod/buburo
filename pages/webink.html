          <h1>Webink</h1>
          <p>
            Webink is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to offer users an engaging platform for discovering
            and reading manga. This platform integrates various sources (with no responsibility for the content provided
            by those sources).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Webink home page features trending manga and the latest releases, making it easy for users to stay
            up-to-date. It also includes a search functionality that allows users to search for manga by their selected
            source or by the titles saved in their library. The Library is where users can save their favorite manga
            (from any source), set a status for each manga, and rank them. The links to manga in the library are stored
            on the device to track chapter progress. Additionally, users can save their library to Google Firebase store
            when connected through Google social login, allowing them to synchronize their library across multiple
            devices.

                  Yes! Webink is an application that aggregates multiple external sources already available on the web
                  for reading. Currently, there are four sources available in English. The addition of new sources,
                  including those in other languages, is something that requires careful evaluation and development
                  time. While I’m always looking to expand the available content, each integration must be analyzed to
                  ensure compatibility and functionality. If you have suggestions for new sources, feel free to reach
                  out!

                  No! Webink is simply an application that provides access to existing content and aims to enhance the
                  reading experience. All content is created, edited, and managed by the original sources. Webink does
                  not host, modify, or control any of it. Think of Webink as a visual interface that allows users to
                  browse and read content from external sources. The responsibility for the content itself lies entirely
                  with the respective source providers.

                data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
                <div class="accordion-body">
                  No! Webink does not restrict access to any content from external sources, as the app itself is not
                  responsible for hosting or managing that content. While there is an option to create an account using
                  Google or Apple, at the moment, this does not provide any additional features. The main purpose of
                  account creation is to enable future functionality, such as syncing your favorite reading items across
                  multiple devices. This synchronization feature may become a premium option in the future, but for now,
                  it is not yet available. More details will be provided when this functionality is introduced.

                To create or login into an account, you need go to the Library tab and tap the account icon located in
                the top right corner of the App Bar. This will open a page where you can sign in using Google or Apple.
                If you wish to delete your account, you can do so from the same account page. Simply tap the “Delete
                Account” button. Once you confirm the deletion, a notification will appear informing you that your
                account will be permanently removed in 15 days. During this 15-day period, you have the option to cancel
                the deletion if you change your mind. However, if the process is not canceled within this timeframe,
                your account and all associated data will be permanently deleted.
